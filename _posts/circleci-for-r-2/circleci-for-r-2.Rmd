In my previous [post][circleci-for-r-1] on using [CircleCI][] for R, I provided
a basic setup to start testing an R package. Now I'll discuss how to customize
the configuration, specifically the following topics:

* [Test multiple versions of R with workflows](#workflows)
* [Cache the R packages](#cache)
* [Calculate code coverage with covr and Codecov](#coverage)
* [Add a status badge to your README file](#badge)

## Test multiple versions of R with workflows {#workflows}

In the basic setup from the previous [post][circleci-for-r-1], the version of R
was specified by the tag of the Docker image on DockerHub:

```
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:3.5.3
```

Unfortunately it's not possible to simply list multiple Docker images and then
have the same steps performed in each image. This behavior is possible using a
[build matrix](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-matrix/) in Travis CI or
AppVeyor. Instead, each separate job has to list its own steps. This is more
verbose, but using [CircleCI Workflows][workflows] provides much more
flexibility. For example, you can have jobs depend on other jobs and even share
files across jobs.

[workflows]: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/

To demonstrate, the configuration file below tests an R package using the both
the release version of R (currently 3.6.0) and the development version of R.

```
version: 2
jobs:
  release:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:3.6.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install package dependencies
          command: R -e "devtools::install_deps(dep = TRUE)"
      - run:
          name: Build package
          command: R CMD build .
      - run:
          name: Check package
          command: R CMD check *tar.gz
  devel:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:devel
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install package dependencies
          command: R -e "devtools::install_deps(dep = TRUE)"
      - run:
          name: Build package
          command: R CMD build .
      - run:
          name: Check package
          command: R CMD check *tar.gz
workflows:
  version: 2
  all:
    jobs:
      - release
      - devel
```

This involves a lot of repeated code, which makes it more difficult to update
(e.g. if you wanted to add the flag `--as-cran` to `R CMD check` for all the
jobs). One option is to save each step in its own script inside of the
`.circleci` directory, and then have each of the jobs execute each file for a
given step. This allows you to update the code in one place and affect every
job. This has the added benefit of making it easier to debug your code
interactively because you can quickly run the same scripts in a local Docker
container. This is the strategy I use in the [config.yml for testing my R
package workflowr][workflowr-config].

[workflowr-config]: https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml

A second option is to use [YAML anchor syntax][yaml-anchor]. This allows you to
specify YAML entries that can be reused throughout the file. For example, the
file below runs the same steps in three different Docker images while only
writing the steps in one location:

[yaml-anchor]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Advanced_components

```
version: 2

steps: &steps
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run:
        name: Install package dependencies
        command: R -e "devtools::install_deps(dep = TRUE)"
    - run:
        name: Build package
        command: R CMD build .
    - run:
        name: Check package
        command: R CMD check *tar.gz

jobs:
  release:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:3.6.0
    <<: *steps
  oldrel:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:3.5.3
    <<: *steps
  devel:
    docker:
      - image: rocker/verse:devel
    <<: *steps

workflows:
  version: 2
  all:
    jobs:
      - release
      - devel
      - oldrel
```

You can see this approach used by the [pyodide project][pyodide-config] and also
in my example repository [ci4r][ci4r-matrix-config].

[pyodide-config]: https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/blob/8f675bf06396e839aae29edfe2ff8c3b6e6c024c/.circleci/config.yml#L3

## Cache the R packages {#cache}

A large fraction of a job's build time is dedicated to installing package
dependencies, especially on Linux which always build packages from source. Thus
a guaranteed way to reduce build times is to cache the R packages.

Because [CircleCI Workflows][workflows] allow arbitrarily complex build
pipelines, CircleCI also provides a [complex caching
mechanism](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/). If you only have one job, I
recommend ignoring this complexity entirely. To cache the R packages, add the
following steps below. The `restore_cache` needs to before the installation step and
the `save_cache` step after it. The nice thing is that since
`devtools::install_deps()` always installs updated versions if available, you
don't have to worry about the packages in the cache becoming outdated.

```
    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - cache

      - save_cache:
          key: cache
          paths:
            - "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
```

However, this strategy won't work if you are building for different versions of
R since these will require their own separate caches. Instead, you can create a
separate cache for each job by adding the job name to the cache key.

```
    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - cache-{{ .Environment.CIRCLE_JOB }}

      - save_cache:
          key: cache-{{ .Environment.CIRCLE_JOB }}
          paths:
            - "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
```

Lastly, if you wanted the cache to be invalidated every time a specific file is
updated, e.g. `DESCRIPTION`, you could use the following cache key:

```
    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - cache-{{ .Environment.CIRCLE_JOB }}-{{ checksum "DESCRIPTION" }}

      - save_cache:
          key: cache-{{ .Environment.CIRCLE_JOB }}-{{ checksum "DESCRIPTION" }}
          paths:
            - "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
```

## Calculate code coverage with covr and Codecov {#coverage}

To calculate the code coverage of your tests with [covr][] and [Codecov][],
add the following step to one of the jobs:

[covr]: https://covr.r-lib.org/
[Codecov]: https://codecov.io/

```
      - run:
          name: Calculate code coverage
          command: r -e 'covr::codecov()'
```

Fortunately, CircleCI doesn't require any extra configuration! See the [covr
docs on using Codecov](https://github.com/r-lib/covr#codecov) if you haven't
used this service before.

## Add a status badge to your README file {#badge}

Once you've started testing your R package on CircleCI, you'll want to share its
current status in the README file. In the Project Settings, there is a section
named Status Badges. This let's you choose the output format and, if desired, a
specific branch. Most likely you'll want Markdown format for the master branch,
which is shown below:

```
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/<username>/<repository>/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/<username>/<repository>/tree/master)
```

Copy-paste this to the top of your `README.md` file to start sharing.

## Conclusion

In this post, I detailed how to test multiple versions of R with workflows,
cache the R packages, calculate code coverage with covr and Codecov, and add a
status badge to your README file. However, using [CircleCI
Workflows][workflows], it's possible to create much more complex testing
pipelines if your package needs it. Is there any additional task you'd like to
know how to accomplish using CircleCI?

If you're interested in how best to use CircleCI for testing R packages, I have
an open [Pull Request][pr] to add a function `use_circleci()` to the [usethis][]
package. I'd appreciate any feedback on the default setup this function
provides.
