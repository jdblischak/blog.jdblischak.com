Continuous integration (CI) is traditionally used for testing software and also
optionally deploying the code to be executed on a different server. However, I
sometimes want to be able to have the CI job commit changes back to the Git
repository that initially triggered the CI build. For example, if I have
automated a data analysis, I want the latest version of the report to be
committed back the repository. Another example is committing the latest version
of the documentation (e.g. to the gh-pages branch of a GitHub repository).

As I mentioned in my [first post on using CircleCI][circleci-for-r-1], I have
found that configuring CircleCI to commit back to a Git repository to be easier
compared to other CI platforms. Below I detail the steps required.

## Initial setup

This post assumes you already have already done the following:

1. Created a GitHub repository
1. Activated CI builds for the repository on CircleCI

If you haven't done this, see the CircleCI documentation [Getting
Started][circleci-start].

## Overview and terminology

The overall goal is to automatically save some artifact generated by a CI job
(e.g. report, plot, documentation).^[Version control purists will object to
saving generated content in a version control repository. And sure, if you are a
part of a team working on a large enterprise codebase, you would be wise to save
generated content on a separate server for sharing with others. But for
individuals or small teams with fewer resources, saving generated content in the
original Git repository is a practical choice with plenty of benefits: keep
everything in one place, serve HTML files with GitHub Pages, record history of
changes, etc.] To accomplish this, the main challenge is authenticating the CI
server to be able to commit to your repository on your behalf.

In this post, I will detail how to setup an SSH deploy key with write access to
your repository. I recommend this method because it is straight-forward and
secure. If your private key gets exposed (e.g. accidentially printing it in a CI
log), an attacker would only gain access to that one repository. In a later
section, I briefly explain [alternative authentication
options](#alternative-authentication-options).

You already have one deploy key setup for your repository. When you activate
CircleCI to build a GitHub repository, it automatically adds a key to the GitHub
repository. In fact, you probably received an email from GitHub with the title
"A new public key was added to &lt;account&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;" alerting you
to the fact that this happened. You can navigate to view the key on GitHub by
going to Settings -> Deploy Keys. Note that this key is named "CircleCI".
Importantly, it is "Read-only". This means that CircleCI currently only has
permission to read from the repository. If you add a `git push` to your CI job,
it will fail with an authentication error.

Thus you need to generate a new pair of SSH keys. You will add the public key to
your GitHub repository as a deploy key with write access. Next you will
add the private key to the corresponding project on CircleCI. Lastly, you
will update the CircleCI configuration file so that it pushes to GitHub. Each
of these steps is explained below.

## Generate one-off SSH keys

First you need to create some one-off SSH keys that will only be used by
CircleCI to authenticate with this one GitHub repository. You can follow the
standard instructions from GitHub for [generating a new SSH
key][github-ssh-key]. However, there is one main difference. You will
immediately delete the key from your local computer afterwards, thus you want to
make sure you don't break your current setup. If you already have SSH keys on
your machine, they are likely in the default location: `~/.ssh/`. ^[**WARNING:
Do not be tempted to use your existing SSH keys.** If an SSH key linked to your
GitHub account is exposed, an attacker would have access to all of your public
and private repositories.] You can use the flag `-f` to specify the location of
the output key files. Run the commands below to generate new SSH keys.^[The
comment passed to `-C` can be whatever you like. It's purpose is to remind you
what the key is for.] When asked for a passphrase, press enter twice to not add
a passphrase to the key.

```
mkdir /tmp/ssh-temp/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "CircleCI User Key" -f /tmp/ssh-temp/key
```

This created the private key `/tmp/ssh-temp/key` and the public key
`/tmp/ssh-temp/key.pub`.

In order for the key to work, it must be in [PEM format][pem]. Confirm this by
running the code below. The first line of the private key field must be
`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

```
head -n 1 /tmp/ssh-temp/key
```

If your version of `ssh-keygen` didn't produce that line verbatim, delete the
keys and re-run the command with the additional flag `-m PEM`.

## Add the public key to GitHub

Next navigate to your repository on GitHub. Click on Settings and then select
"Deploy keys" from the menu on the left. You should see that there is already a
"Read-only" key named "CircleCI". Click "Add deploy key". You can name it
whatever you like.^[In the screenshot below, you can see that I named it
"CircleCI User Key". This is because at the time I was confused by the CircleCI
documentation. It is a deploy key since it is associated with a single
repository. A user key is one that is assoiciated with a user account.] Then
copy-paste the contents of the public key `/tmp/ssh-temp/key.pub` into the Key
field. Lastly, check the box "Allow write access" so that CircleCI can push back
to GitHub.

## Add the private key to CircleCI

Next navigate to the project on CircleCI. The URL follows the pattern:
`https://circleci.com/gh/<account>/<repo>`.^[For convenience, I recommend the
Firefox addon [Open CircleCI
Workflows](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-circleci-workflows/).
Whenever you have a GitHub repository open in your browser, it inserts a button
with the CircleCI logo into the address bar. Clicking on this button takes you
directly to the project on CircleCI.]

Don't click on the "Settings" in the menu on the left. That is for user
settings. Instead, click on the gear icon in the top right. Then choose "SSH
Permissions" and "Add SSH key". You can put whatever you like in the Hostname
field to remind you that this key is for pushing to GitHub. Copy-paste the
private key in `/tmp/ssh-temp/key` into the field "Private Key". As the name
implies, it is really important that you do not expose this key.

## Add the fingerprint to configuration file

After adding the private key to CircleCI, you will see it displays a fingerprint
for the key. You will need to add this key to the configuration file
`.circleci/config.yml` in your repository using the step `add_ssh_keys`.
Copy-paste the fingerprint into an `add_ssh_keys` step as shown below:

```
    steps:
      - checkout
      - add_ssh_keys:
          fingerprints:
            - "<copy-paste-fingerprint-here>"
      - run:
```

## Push to GitHub

Now that CircleCI has permission to push to GitHub, you'll need to add a step to
do this. It can look something like below. It configures Git, commits any
changes to all tracked files, and then pushes to GitHub. The `--allow-empty`
prevents an error in the case where no files were changed. The `[skip ci]`
prevents the job from running in an infinite loop due to constantly
re-triggering the CI build.

```
      - run:
          name: Commit to GitHub
          command: |
            git config user.email "<insert-the-email-you-use-with-github>"
            git config user.name "CircleCI Job"
            git commit --allow-empty -am "Automatic commit from CircleCI [skip ci]"
            git push origin master
```

Now you probably don't want to always attempt to push to GitHub. For example,
when CI builds are triggered by a Pull Request. The updated version below
requires a specific CircleCI user account and that it is not a Pull Request.
Otherwise it doesn't attempt to commit.

```
      - run:
          name: Commit to GitHub
          command: |
            if [[ "${CIRCLE_USERNAME}" = "<account>" && -z "${CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST}"]]
            then
              echo "Committing to GitHub"
              git config user.email "<insert-the-email-you-use-with-github>"
              git config user.name "CircleCI Job"
              git commit --allow-empty -am "Automatic commit from CircleCI [skip ci]"
              git push origin master
            else
              echo "Not committing to GitHub"
            fi
```

Commit this update to the local configuration file and then push to GitHub. This
time the build should result in a new commit to the repository.

## Delete the local SSH key files

Once you've confirmed everything is working as expected, delete the one-off SSH
keys from your local machine:

```
rm -r /tmp/ssh-temp/
```

## Conclusion

Now any time you want CircleCI to automatically update the results of an
analysis or documentation files for a GitHub repository, you can follow these
steps to setup the authentication.

Lastly, I'll note that a powerful combination is to [schedule the
workflow][circleci-schedule] to be run on CircleCI at regular intervals. Then
the repository will stay up-to-date without requiring any intervention.

## Alternative authentication options

There are alternative options for authentication:

* **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**: You could generate a GitHub PAT,
either for your own account or a bot account, with the required scope to write
to your repository (`public_repo` for a public repository, `repo` for a private
repository). You would then define this as an environment variable in your
CircleCI build (e.g. `GITHUB_PAT`), which would authenticate you to push to
your repository using the following URL pattern:
`https://workflowr:$GITHUB_PAT@github.com/<account>/<repo>.git`. I dislike this
option because it is not possible to limit the scope of a PAT to a single
repository. In other words, if a PAT with write permissions is exposed, it gives
write access to every repository owned by that account.

* **SSH user key**: CircleCI has a convenient option to register a user key.
In the CircleCI project settings page, choose "Checkout SSH keys" and then
"Authorize with GitHub". This will add a public key to your GitHub account,
and CircleCI keeps the private key. Now your CI build will be able to access
all of your public and private repositories on GitHub. I recommend this option
if your CI build needs write access to multiple repositories (or read access to
multiple private repositories). If you only need write access to the one
repository, it is more secure to use a deploy key since it has limited access
to your account.

    If you want to create a user key, you can automate this even more using the
    R package [ropenscilabs/circle][circle] developed by [Patrick
    Schratz][pat-s]. It requires some initial setup: 1) generate a CircleCI API key
    and save it in `~/.Renviron` as `R_CIRCLE`, and 2) generate a GitHub PAT
    and save it in `~/.Renviron` as `GITHUB_PAT`. Then the user key can be
    created with the function `use_circle_deploy()`.
