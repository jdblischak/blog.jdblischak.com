## Motivation

For the [OmicNavigator][] web app I helped develop (see my [previous blog
post][omicnavigator-post]), we allow the user to include external linkouts for
more information on the features (see example screenshot below), e.g.
a link to the [Ensembl][] page for each gene. In order to make the display
appealing and intuitive, we wanted to display the links using each website's
unique favicon. Since we don't know in advance which external resources a user
will include, we needed a general solution that could obtain a favicon for any
website.

[OmicNavigator]: https://github.com/abbvie-external/OmicNavigator
[omicnavigator-post]: ../omicnavigator/
[Ensembl]: https://www.ensembl.org/


![The first 2 columns of the interactive table contain favicons which are linkouts to external websites](../omicnavigator/img/differential-expression.png)

My initial plan was to use a 3rd party service to obtain the favicon to display.
Search engine providers like [Google][] and [DuckDuckGo][] display the
favicon for each site in their search results, and they conveniently provide an
API for others to query their favicon databases. Frustratingly though, the
coverage was not as good as I had anticipated, especially for the scientific
websites our users were likely to need. Some examples:

[Google]: https://www.google.com/
[DuckDuckGo]: https://duckduckgo.com/

* DuckDuckGo has the favicon for GitHub. Google used to not have it at all, and
  currently they have a grainy version
    * https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/github.com.ico
    <img
      src="https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/github.com.ico"
      alt="GitHub's favicon from DuckDuckGo"
      height="20px"
    />
    * https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=github.com
    <img
      src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=github.com"
      alt="GitHub's favicon from Google"
      height="20px"
    />

* Google has the favicon for [AmiGO][amigo] but not DuckDuckGo
    * https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=amigo.geneontology.org
    <img
      src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=geneontology.org"
      alt="AmiGO's favicon from Google"
      height="20px"
    />
    * https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/amigo.geneontology.org.ico
        <img
      src="https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/amigo.geneontology.org.ico"
      alt="GitHub's favicon from DuckDuckGo"
      height="20px"
    />

[amigo]: http://amigo.geneontology.org/

Fortunately though they both provide a generic favicon to insert when they don't
have the favicon, as you can see for the DuckDuckGo example above.

Another big limitation is that the search engine providers only have favicons
available for publicly accessible websites. If you have internal websites with
their own favicons, this requires a more involved approach.

Next I looked for available open source [favicon-grabber][] software. As
expected, these are mainly written in more web-oriented programming languages
like JavaScript and PHP.

[favicon-grabber]: https://github.com/topics/favicon-grabber

Grabbing the favicon mainly involves parsing HTML and/or downloading files,
which R can handle, so I decided to create a favicon-grabber for R:
faviconPlease!

## How favicons work

From the [mdn web docs][mdn]:

> A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which
> is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks
> menu.

[mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Favicon

The default option for a website to display a favicon in a web browser tab is to
provide the file `favicon.ico` at the root of the web server. If every web
site used this option, then finding favicons would be trivial. Unfortunately
there are [many ways to configure a favicon][favicon-configure].

[favicon-configure]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#How_to_use

When a website doesn't provide `favicon.ico`, they often specify the
favicon file with a `<link>` element in the `<head>` of the file. The `rel`
attribute is set to either `"icon"` or `"shortcut icon"`.

```
<link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">
```

This also isn't too bad. You can parse the HTML and then query with [XPath][]
to obtain the URL.

[Xpath]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath

A big challenge is that the `href` attribute with the path to the file can be
specified in so many different ways:

```
<!--  absolute: the full URL to the file -->
<link rel="icon" href="https://example.com/path/to/favicon.ico">

<!--  protocol-relative - everything but the http(s) -->
<link rel="icon" href="//othersite.com/path/to/favicon.ico">

<!--  root-relative - relative to the root of the server, as opposed to the current file -->
<link rel="icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico">

<!--  relative - relative to the current file -->
<link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">
```

And an added twist is that relative paths can be globally modified by the
[`base`][base] element:

[base]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base

> The <base> HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in
> a document. There can be only one <base> element in a document.

## Implementation

My goal was to create a single function that abstracted away all of the above
complexity. You pass a URL, and it returns a URL to a favicon you can use to
display in your app. It'll try various strategies to obtain a favicon, and fall
back to one of the default favicons from DuckDuckGo or Google. Here's an
example:

```{r github.com}
library(faviconPlease)
faviconPlease("https://github.com/")
```

By default, `faviconPlease()` uses the following strategy to find the URL to the
favicon for a given website. It stops once it finds a URL and returns it.

1. Download the HTML file and search its `<head>` for any `<link>` elements with
   `rel="icon"` or `rel="shortcut icon"`.

2. Download the HTML file at the root of the server (i.e. discard the path) and
   search its `<head>` for any `<link>` elements with `rel="icon"` or
   `rel="shortcut icon"`.

3. Attempt to download a file called `favicon.ico` at the root of the server.
   This is the default location that a browser looks if the HTML file does not
   specify an alternative location in a `<link>` element. If the file `favicon.ico`
   is successfully downloaded, then this URL is returned.

4. If the above steps fail, as a fallback, use the
   [favicon service](https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/favicons/)
   provided by the search engine [DuckDuckGo][], e.g.
   <https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/github.com.ico>. This provides a nice
   default for websites that don’t have a favicon (or can’t be easily found).

I also wanted to make sure the function was extensible and customizable so that
it could be useful to others without me having to implement every alternative
strategy for finding favicons. To accomplish this, I took advantage of the
feature that R has [first-class functions][first-class]. The argument `functions`
accepts a list of functions to find a favicon URL. And the argument `fallback`
accepts a single function that always returns a URL (e.g. from DuckDuckGo).

[first-class]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function

```{r faviconPlease}
args(faviconPlease)
```

This way, if you instead wanted to first check for the existence of
`favicon.ico` and use Google as a fallback, you could adjust the functions passed
to `faviconPlease`. In the case of github.com, it does find a `favicon.ico`
file.

```{r rearranged}
library(faviconPlease)
faviconPlease("https://github.com/", functions = list(faviconIco, faviconLink),
              fallback = faviconGoogle)
```

Furthermore, if you wanted to create your own favicon search function, you could
model it after `faviconLink()` and `faviconIco()`, and then pass it in the list
of functions.

## Challenges

The first challenge is that `download.file()` is not fool-proof. I first
encountered this issue when trying to write workshop tutorials. A simple call to
`download.file()` will fail in many different situations depending on the
operating system. `?download.file` recommends:

> Setting the `method` should be left to the end user.

And thus this is what I did, by exposing the argument `method` (and others) to
pass from `faviconIco()` to `download.file()`. Fortunately it is also possible
to control this behavior with a global option `"download.file.method"`.

A second big challenge is security policies. As a primary example, Ubuntu 20.04
increased the default security restrictions when accessing web resources, and
many websites haven't updated their SSL certificates. This is one way the
ability to create custom functions is useful. To use less-restrictive security
policies, you can wrap the call to `faviconIco()` in a new function and
specifically pass the flags `--no-check-certificate` and
`--ciphers=DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=1` directly to `wget`.

```{r faviconIcoUbuntu20, eval=FALSE}
faviconIcoUbuntu20 <- function(scheme, server, path) {
  faviconIco(scheme, server, path, method = "wget",
             extra = c("--no-check-certificate",
                       "--ciphers=DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=1"))
}
```

Lastly, it's a challenge to anticipate all the different ways a website may
serve their favicon. If you find any websites that have a favicon but that
`faviconPlease()` fails to find, please open an [Issue][issue] so that I can
potentially expand the support for more sites.
