Hi! I'm John. I'm the author of the R package [workflowr][] for reproducible
research. This is my personal blog where I'll share my thoughts on...you guessed
it, R and reproducible research.

I created this site using [blogdown][] with [Yihui's][yihui] minimal Hugo theme
[XMin][hugo-xmin]. The blog content is licensed under [CC-BY 4.0][cc-by].
